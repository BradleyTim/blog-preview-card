- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned how to use and self-host css fonts using the @fontface without unnecesarilly depending on the fonts hosted by google.

See below code snippet:

```css
@font-face {
  font-family: 'Figtree'; 
  src: url('/assets/fonts/Figtree-VariableFont_wght.ttf') format('ttf'), 
       url('/assets/fonts/static/Figtree-Medium.ttf') format('ttf'); 
  font-weight: 500;  
  font-style: normal;   
}
```

### Useful resources

- [Self-hosting fonts explained (including Google fonts) // @font-face tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK-yy6C2Nck) - This helped me with loading the Figtree Font. Kevin Powell is good at teaching and explaining CSS cencepts. 
- [Getting started with Variable fonts on the web](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fVymQ7SZw0) - This is also a video tutorial by Kevin Powell on variable fonts.
